# Error Calc

Calculate error propagation

## Why does this exist

I'm too lazy to calculate all the errors in CHEM 373 by hand

## How to use this thing

Good luck

## Disclaimer

As much as I'm confident in my algorithms, I do not guarantee the accuracies of the calculations, and I am not responsible for any bad grades and lab reports this may cause.
